<h1> Loga Game Jam 2023 </h1>
<p> I made this game for the Loga Game Jam 2023, the theme was Magic Forest and the sub-theme was something related to Letea forest or Caraorman forest, two forests from Romania from "Delta Dunarii". </p>

<p> The lore of the game is that you are Zeus and you have to protect your children from all the wild monsters, the kids being Artemis and Apollo who were born around Letea forest. </p>
